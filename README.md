Scenario


A Building Society is introducing a new savings account which pays a variable amount of interest depending on
the balance of the account. The interest is calculated based on the following bands:


< £1,000 - 1%


£1,000 - < £5,000 - 1.5%


£5,000 - < £10,000 - 2%


£10,000 - < £50,000 - 2.5%


£50,000 + - 3%


Write code that, given a balance, will calculate the amount of interest (in pounds and pence) that should be paid.


e.g. A balance of £1,001 would pay interest at 1.5% resulting in an interest rate of £15.02
